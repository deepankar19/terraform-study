Hereâ€™s a detailed description for the provided configuration that explains each part of the Terraform setup:

---

### Description of the Configuration:

- **Provider Configuration**:
  ```hcl
  provider "aws" {
    region = "ap-south-1"
  }
  ```
  This block sets the AWS provider and specifies the region as `ap-south-1` (Mumbai). All AWS resources created in this configuration will be deployed to the `ap-south-1` region.

- **VPC Module**:
  ```hcl
  module "vpc" {
    source = "./module/vpc"

    vpc_config = {
      cidr_block = "10.0.0.0/16"
      name       = "my-test-vpc"
    }
  ```
  The VPC module is sourced from a local directory (`./module/vpc`) and is responsible for creating a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) in the `ap-south-1` region. The VPC will have the following configuration:
  
  - **CIDR Block**: The VPC will have a CIDR block of `10.0.0.0/16`, allowing for 65,536 IP addresses.
  - **VPC Name**: The VPC will be named `"my-test-vpc"`.

- **Subnet Configuration**:
  ```hcl
  subnet_config = {
    public_subnet-1 = {
      cidr_block = "10.0.0.0/24"
      azs        = "ap-south-1a"
      public     = true
    }
    public_subnet-2 = {
      cidr_block = "10.0.2.0/24"
      azs        = "ap-south-1a"
      public     = true
    }

    private_subnet = {
      cidr_block = "10.0.1.0/24"
      azs        = "ap-south-1b"
    }
  }
  ```
  This part of the module defines the subnets that will be created within the VPC:
  
  - **Public Subnet 1**:
    - **CIDR Block**: `10.0.0.0/24` (256 IP addresses).
    - **Availability Zone**: `ap-south-1a`.
    - **Public**: `true`, meaning this subnet will be configured as a public subnet.

  - **Public Subnet 2**:
    - **CIDR Block**: `10.0.2.0/24` (256 IP addresses).
    - **Availability Zone**: `ap-south-1a`.
    - **Public**: `true`, making this another public subnet.

  - **Private Subnet**:
    - **CIDR Block**: `10.0.1.0/24` (256 IP addresses).
    - **Availability Zone**: `ap-south-1b`.
    - **Public**: Not defined, so this subnet will be private by default.

---

This configuration will create a VPC named `my-test-vpc` with one private subnet and two public subnets, all deployed in the `ap-south-1` region. The public subnets are both placed in `ap-south-1a`, and the private subnet is in `ap-south-1b`. This setup is commonly used to segregate resources with public access from those that require privacy within the VPC.
